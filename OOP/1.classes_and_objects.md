# ðŸ“¦ Classes & Objects

Kickstart your OOP journey! Classes are blueprints, objects are the real-world things you build from them.

---

**Summary:**
- Classes = plans
- Objects = things built from plans
- OOP starts here!

## Class

In object-oriented programming, a **Class** is a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects. It is the logical representation that defines asset of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. A class does not occupy memory on its own. It's essentially a definition or a structure from which individual objects are instantiated.  
  
For example, Consider the following code snippet representing an **Employee** class:

```java

// Employee Class
class Employee {
    private int salary; // to store the salary of employee
    
    public String employeeName; // to store the name of employee
    
    // Method to set the employee name as given input
    public void setName(String s) {
        employeeName = s;
    }
    
    // Method to set the salary as given input
    public void setSalary(int val) {
        salary = val;
    }
    
    // Method to get the salary of the employee
    public int getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
```

## Object

An **object** is an instance of a class. When an object is created from a class, memory is allocated for it, and it holds the data as specified by the class. An object interacts with other parts of the program, and methods can be called and attributes accessed that belong to it.  
  
For example, Consider the following code snippet demonstrating the creation of objects from the Employee class:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Employee class
        Employee obj1 = new Employee();
        
        // Setting different attributes of object 1 using available methods
        obj1.setName("Raj"); // Set name to "Raj"
        obj1.setSalary(10000); // Set salary to 10,000
        
        // Creating another object of Employee class
        Employee obj2 = new Employee();
        
        // Setting different attributes of object 2 in a similar way
        obj2.setName("Rahul"); // Set name to "Rahul"
        obj2.setSalary(15000); // Set salary to 15,000
        
        // Accessing the attributes of different objects
        System.out.println("Salary of " + obj1.employeeName + " is " + obj1.getSalary());
        System.out.println("Salary of " + obj2.employeeName + " is " + obj2.getSalary());
    }
}

class Employee {
    private int salary; // to store the salary of employee
    
    public String employeeName; // to store the name of employee
    
    // Method to set the employee name as given input
    public void setName(String s) {
        employeeName = s;
    }
    
    // Method to set the salary as given input
    public void setSalary(int val) {
        salary = val;
    }
    
    // Method to get the salary of the employee
    public int getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
```
