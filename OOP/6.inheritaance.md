# ðŸ§¬ Inheritance

Pass it on! Inheritance lets one class use stuff from anotherâ€”like family traits.

**Summary:**
- Share code
- Parent & child classes
- Less repetition!

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass) to inherit the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class (superclass). It is the mechanism that promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.  
In Java, this concept allows a subclass to inherit or extend the functionality of a superclass, enabling the subclass to reuse code and, in many cases, modify or add new behavior.  
  
For example, consider a base class **Animal** that has a method `sound()`. Subclasses like **Dog** and **Cat** can inherit the `sound()` method from **Animal** and override it to produce specific sounds for each type of animal.  
  
Consider the following code snippet:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.*;

// Parent class or super class
class School {
    // Private attribute for school name
    private String name;

    // Constructor initializes the school name
    School() {
        name = "DPS"; // Default school name
    }

    // Method to print the school name
    void printSchoolName() {
        System.out.println("School name: " + name);
    }
}

// Subclass or child class
class Student extends School {
    // Private attribute for student name
    private String name;

    // Constructor initializes the student name
    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Method to print the student name
    void printStudentName() {
        System.out.println("Student name: " + name);
    }
}

// Main class to execute the program
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new student object with the name "Raj"
        Student student = new Student("Raj");

        // Print the student's name
        student.printStudentName();

        // Print the school's name
        student.printSchoolName();
    }
}
```

#### Parent Class

The parent class (also known as the superclass) is the class that provides common properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that are shared by one or more subclasses. It serves as a template or blueprint from which other classes (subclasses) can inherit. For example, School class.  

#### Subclass (Child Class)

A subclass (also known as a child class) is a class that inherits from a parent class. The subclass can reuse, extend, or override the attributes and methods of the parent class to specialize or modify the inherited functionality. For example, Student class.

#### Types of Inheritance:

In Java, there are three major types of inheritance:

- Single Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance

## 1. Single Inheritance

```java

import java.util.*;
// Parent class
class Animal {
    // Method to represent the eating behavior of an animal
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class inheriting from the Animal class
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Method specific to the Dog class to represent barking behavior
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("This dog barks.");
    }
}

// Main class to execute the program
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the Dog class
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        // Call the eat method inherited from the Animal class
        dog.eat();  // Output: This animal eats food.

        // Call the bark method defined in the Dog class
        dog.bark(); // Output: This dog barks.
    }
}
```

---

## 2. Multilevel Inheritance

```java
import java.util.*;
// Parent class representing general animals
class Animal {
    // Method to define the eating behavior of animals
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Intermediate class representing mammals, inheriting from Animal
class Mammal extends Animal {
    // Method to define the walking behavior of mammals
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("This mammal walks.");
    }
}

// Subclass representing dogs, inheriting from Mammal
class Dog extends Mammal {
    // Method to define the barking behavior specific to dogs
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("This dog barks.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate multilevel inheritance
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the Dog class
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        // Call the eat method inherited from the Animal class
        dog.eat(); // Output: This animal eats food.

        // Call the walk method inherited from the Mammal class
        dog.walk(); // Output: This mammal walks.

        // Call the bark method defined in the Dog class
        dog.bark(); // Output: This dog barks.
    }
}
```

## 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

```java
import java.util.*;
// Parent class representing general animals
class Animal {
    // Method to define the eating behavior common to all animals
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass representing dogs, inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Method to define the barking behavior specific to dogs
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("This dog barks.");
    }
}

// Subclass representing cats, inheriting from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
    // Method to define the meowing behavior specific to cats
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("This cat meows.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate hierarchical inheritance
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the Dog class
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        // Create an object of the Cat class
        Cat cat = new Cat();

        // Call the eat method inherited from the Animal class using the Dog object
        dog.eat(); // Output: This animal eats food.

        // Call the bark method specific to the Dog class
        dog.bark(); // Output: This dog barks.

        // Call the eat method inherited from the Animal class using the Cat object
        cat.eat(); // Output: This animal eats food.

        // Call the meow method specific to the Cat class
        cat.meow(); // Output: This cat meows.
    }
}
```

## Important Concepts in Inheritance

#### 1. Access Modifier:

Access modifiers define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables in different contexts, including inheritance. Learn more about it here: [Access Modifier](https://takeuforward.org/plus/oops/core-principles-of-oops/access-modifiers)  

#### 2. Method Overriding:

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. This supports runtime polymorphism and enables dynamic behavior. There are some key rules for **Overriding**:

- The method must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the parent class.
- The method in the child class cannot have a more restrictive access modifier than the parent method.
- Only inheritable methods (public or protected) can be overridden.
- The `@Override` annotation is recommended for clarity.

  

#### 3. "Super" Keyword:

The `super` keyword is used in inheritance to:

- **Access Parent Class Members:** Refer to parent class methods or variables when they are shadowed by child class members.
- **Invoke Parent Class Constructor:** Call the parent class constructor to initialize the inherited state.

## Difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding

- **Definition:**
    - Method Overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (number, type, or order of parameters).
    - Method Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.
- **Inheritance Dependency:**
    - Method Overloading does not require inheritance. It happens within the same class.
    - Method Overriding requires inheritance; occurs between a parent class and its subclass.
- **Parameters:**
    - In Method Overloading, methods must have different parameter lists (number, type, or order).
    - In Method Overriding, the method must have the same parameter list as the method in the parent class.
- **Access Modifiers:**
    - In Method Overloading, methods can have any access modifier; no restrictions..
    - The access modifier in the overriding method cannot be more restrictive than in the parent class.

## Important Point

#### Multilevel Inheritance:

Along with the three types of inheritances discussed above, there is another type of inheritance - Multiple Inheritance.  
  
**Multiple inheritance** refers to a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to combine the functionality of multiple parent classes.

#### Diamond Problem:

Diamond Problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have methods with the same name. The compiler cannot determine which method to execute.


![[Image_2-SlHU0Ztb.png]]

If both B and C inherit from A and override a method, and D inherits from both B and C, which version of the method should D inherit? This ambiguity is why Java restricts multiple inheritance for classes.
