# ðŸšª Access Modifiers

Who gets in? Access modifiers control who can see or use parts of your code.

---

**Summary:**
- public, private, protected
- Control access
- Keep things secure!

Access modifiers in object-oriented programming are **keywords** that define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and other members of a program. They determine which parts of the program can interact with a particular component, ensuring that code adheres to encapsulation â€” a key principle of object-oriented programming.  
Access modifiers provide a controlled interaction between objects and help enforce good design practices, making programs more reliable, scalable, and easy to debug.

## Purpose of Access Modifiers

In object-oriented programming, the access modifiers play a key role and serve the following purposes:

- **Encapsulation:** Ensures sensitive data and methods are protected from unintended access.
- **Controlled Access:** Allows programmers to specify which parts of the program can interact with certain components.
- **Modularity and Security:** Helps in maintaining the integrity of data by restricting unwanted modifications.
- **Flexibility:** Provides mechanisms for controlled sharing of data between classes and packages.

## Types of Access Modifiers

Most of the Object Oriented Progamming languages provide the following **four** acess levels:

- **Public:** Accessible everywhere (within the same class, same package, and outside the package).
- **Private:** Accessible only within the class where it is declared.
- **Protected:** Accessible within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
- **Default:** (No Modifier) Accessible within the same package (package-private).

### 1. Public Access Modifier

The Public Access Modifier can make the attributes and methods of a class accessible from anywhere in the program, including classes outside the package. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Employee {
    public String name; // Public attribute

    public void displayName() { // Public method
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.name = "Alice"; // Accessible globally
        emp.displayName();  // Accessible globally
    }
}
```
Here, the name attribute and displayName() method is set to public because of which they can be accessed from a separate class (Main class).

###### Keypoints:

- Used to provide attributes and methods global access.
- Best suited for methods and attributes that need to be universally available.
- Does not restrict usage or visibility.

### 2. Private Access Modifier

The Private Access Modifier can make the attributes and methods of a class accessible only within the class where they were declared. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private attribute

    // Getter to provide controlled access
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
}

// Main Class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object
        BankAccount acnt = new BankAccount();
        
        System.out.println(acnt.balance); // Throws an error
        System.out.println(acnt.getBalance());
    }
}
```

Here, the balance attribute is set to private because of which it can only be access from within the class (using getBalance() method) and throws an error when accessed outside of the class.

###### Keypoints:

- Restricts access to sensitive data (balance).
- Encourages the use of getter and setter methods to provide controlled access.
- Not visible to subclasses or classes within the same package.

---

### 3. Protected Access Modifier

The Protected Access Modifier can make the attributes and methods of a class accessible within the same package and in subclasses (even if they are in different packages). For example, consider the following code snippet:

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Vehicle {
    protected String type; // Protected attribute

    protected void displayType() { // Protected method
        System.out.println("Vehicle Type: " + type);
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car() {
        this.type = "Car"; // Accessible in the subclass
    }
}
```
Here, the Subclasses can inherit and use the type attribute and displayType() method.

###### Keypoints:

- Promotes **inheritance** by allowing child classes to access certain members of the parent class.
- Provides more visibility than private but less than public.
- Not accessible to unrelated classes outside the package.

### 4. Default (No modifier)

When there is no access modifier specified, by default, the member is **package-private**. Consider the following code snippet:


```java
import java.util.*;
class PackageDemo {
    void showMessage() { // Default access
        System.out.println("Default access in the same package.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PackageDemo demo = new PackageDemo();
        demo.showMessage(); // Accessible because it's in the same package
    }
}
```
