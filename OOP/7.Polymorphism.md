# ðŸŽ­ Polymorphism

One name, many forms! Polymorphism lets you use the same method in different ways.

**Summary:**
- Same name, different jobs
- Flexible code
- OOP magic!

There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:

- Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
- Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

## 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)

In compile-time polymorphism, the method to be called is resolved at compile time. When we say the method is "resolved" at compile-time, it means that the compiler determines the correct method to invoke based on the method's signature (such as method name, parameters, etc.). It is achieved through method overloading or operator overloading (not supported in Java).

```java
import java.util.*;
// Calculator Class
class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    // Method to add two decimal values
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Main class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        
        // Method resolution happens here based on the argument types (int vs double)
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 3));          // Calls int version
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.5, 3.3));      // Calls double version
    }
}
```

## 2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

In run-time polymorphism, the method is resolved during the runtime. It is achieved through method overriding. When we say the method is "resolved" at run-time, it refers to the decision about which method (in the case of method overriding) to call being made at the time the program is actually running. This occurs due to the dynamic method dispatch mechanism, where the JVM decides which method of a subclass to call based on the actual object type (not the reference type) at runtime.

```java
import java.util.*;
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
    
    
// Main class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();  // Animal reference but Dog object
        
        // Method resolution happens here at runtime based on the object type (Dog)
        myAnimal.sound();  // Calls Dog's sound() method at runtime
    }
}
```
Here, the method to be executed is decided at runtime based on the object type.

#### Keypoints:

- Determined at runtime.
- Slower execution compared to compile-time polymorphism due to late binding.
- Examples: Method Overriding.
