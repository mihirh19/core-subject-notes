# üèóÔ∏è Constructors

Give life to your objects! Constructors set things up when you create an object.

**Summary:**
- Constructors = object setup
- Run automatically
- First step in object creation!

## Constructor

A constructor is a special method in a class designed to initialize an object when it is created. It ensures that the object is set up with the required attributes and state before it is used.  
  
Consider the following example to understand the syntax and working of Constructors:

```java

import java.util.*;
class Employee {
    private int salary; // to store the salary of employee

    public String employeeName; // to store the name of employee

    // Constructor
    public Employee() {
        employeeName = "John Doe";
        salary = 5000;
    }

    // Method to set the employee name as given input
    public void setName(String s) {
        employeeName = s;
    }

    // Method to set the salary as given input
    public void setSalary(int val) {
        salary = val;
    }

    // Method to get the salary of the employee
    public int getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}

// Main Class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Employee class
        Employee obj = new Employee();

        // Attributes of object initialized by the constructor
        System.out.println("Default values initialized by the constructor:\n");
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + obj.employeeName);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + obj.getSalary());
    }
}


```

#### Keypoints:

- **Syntax:** A constructor is a method that has the exact same name as the class and does not have a return type (not even void).
- A constructor is called when an object is created. This justifies why the above code snippets gives the shown output.
- If there is no constructor written for the given class, the language by-default triggers the **default constructor**.

## Purpose of Constructor

There are three major purposes behind creating a constructor for a class which are as follows:

- **Object Initialization:** Constructor helps in initializing an object at the time of creation by assigning it default or user-defined values to object attributes.
- **Code Reusability:** Everytime an object is created, the same code is reused preventing writing mulitple lines of codes to initialize different objects.
- **Ensures Default Value:** Ensures that the object is always started in a default state with default values when initiated.

## Types of Constructor:

There are three different types of constructos:

- Non-parameterized Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Copy Constructor

#### 1. Non-parameterized Constructor:

When a constructor does not take any arguments as the input, it is called a Non-parameterized Constructor. For example, in the given code snippet there are not arguments taken by the constructor.

```java
import java.util.*;
 class Employee {
    // Non-parameterised constructor
    Employee() {
        System.out.println("Employee created!");
    }
 }
```
#### 2. Parameterized Constructor:

It is a type of constructor that accepts arguments to initialize attributes with specific values. For example, the following code snippet shows a parameterized constructor initializing the attributes of the object with the arguments provided by the user.

```java
import java.util.*;
class Employee {
    public String employeeName; // To store the name of the employee
    public int salary;          // To store the salary of the employee

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Employee(String name, int salary) {
        this.employeeName = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}

// Main Class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Creating an object of Employee class and passing 
        values for the parameterized constructor */
        Employee obj = new Employee("Raj", 10000);

        // Output
        System.out.println("The salary of employee named " + 
                            obj.employeeName + " is " + obj.salary);
    }
}

```

#### 3. Copy Constructor:

It enables the programmer to create a new object by copying the attributes of an existing object. Java doesn't have an explicit copy constructor like C++ does. However, a copy constructor can be implemented manually by creating a constructor that takes an object of the same class as a parameter and copies its attributes using Constructor Chaining. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.*;
class Employee {
    public String employeeName; // To store the name of the employee
    public int salary;          // To store the salary of the employee

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Employee(String name, int salary) {
        this.employeeName = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    
    // Copy Constructor
    public Employee(Employee employee) {
        // Calling another constructor
        this(employee.employeeName, employee.salary);
    }
}

// Main Class
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Creating an object of Employee class and passing 
        values for the parameterized constructor */
        Employee obj = new Employee("Raj", 10000);
        
        // Creating a copy of obj using Copy constructor
        Employee objCopy = new Employee(obj);
        
        // Printing the attibutes of copied object
        System.out.println("Name of the copied employee: " + objCopy.employeeName);
        System.out.println("Salary of the copied employee: " + objCopy.salary);
    }
}
```
