Monolithic Architecture has less complexity 👉 easier to understand 👉 Higher productivity 🚀

## ✅ When it is good:

1. 🆕 When we are just starting 
2. 🔗 In monolithic architecture, all the modules are present in single system, so they require fewer network calls as compared to other architecture
3. 🔒 It is comparatively easier to secure monolithic system.
4. 🧪 Integration testing is easier.
5. 🤔 Less confusion.

## ❌ Disadvantages of monolithic architecture:

1. 🐞 Every module is combined in a single system, so if there is an error or bug in a single module, it can destroy the complete system.
2. 🔄 Whenever a single module is updated, the whole system needs to be updated to reflect the changes to the users. All modules are present in a single system and are connected to one another, so whole system needs to be updated.
3. ⚠️ If there is any change in a single module's programming language or framework, it will affect the entire system. The entire system needs to be changed because every module is interlinked and tightly coupled.
