## Architecture

	Internal design details for build the application.


### Monolithic Architecture


Web application :  
	Frontend
	Backend
	Data storage

Written & deployed together


Monolithic Architecture has less complexity =>> easier to understand =>> Higher productivity

---

When it is good:

1. When we are just starting 
2. In monolithic architecture, all the modules are present in single system, so they require fewer network calls as compared to other architecture
3. It is comparatively easier to secure monolithic system.
4. Integration testing is easier.
5. Less confusion.

Disadvantages of monolithic architecture:

1. Every module is combined in a single system, so if there is an error or bug in a single module, it can destroy the complete system.
2. Whenever a single module is updated, the whole system needs to be updated to reflect the changes to the users. All modules are present in a single system and are connected to one another, so whole system needs to be updated.
3. If there is any change in a single module's programming language or framework, it will affect the entire system. The entire system needs to be changed because every module is interlinked and tightly coupled.
